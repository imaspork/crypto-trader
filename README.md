This app will utilize:

-   React.JS
-   Framer-motion (animations)
-   Chakra UI and some custom CSS files for the front end. (Styling)
-   Express.js (back end)
-   MongoDB (data storing in the cloud)
-   Cryptocurrency API (data fetching)
-   Lowdb (local database)

I intend to deploy this app to a live website.

Ending functionality will include:

-   The ability to sign up and create an account, including with Google auth.

-   The ability to "purchase, sell, and convert" cryptocurrencies in a simulated-esque fashion.

-   The ability to look at your portfolio history, total worth and other analytics in a text and graphical interface

-   The ability to look at price histories of 100 different cryptocurrencies with a graphical interface with Recharts to give users a pleasant visual experience.
