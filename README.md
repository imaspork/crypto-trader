# Welcome to Crypto Trader (In Progress)

So far this is a blank slate for my Crypto Trader app.

This app will utilize:
- React.JS
- Framer-motion
- Chakra UI and some custom CSS files for the front end.
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Cryptocurrency API


I intend to deploy this app to a live website.

Ending functionality will include:

-   The ability to sign up and create an account, including with Google auth.

-   The ability to "purchase, sell, and convert" cryptocurrencies in a simulated-esque fashion.

-   The ability to look at your portfolio history, total worth and other analytics in a text and graphical interface

-   The ability to look at price histories of 100 different cryptocurrencies with a graphical interface with Frappe or Nivo Rocks in order to give users a pleasant and aesthetic look.
